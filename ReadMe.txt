C.A.R.P.E.
"Corey's Attack, Red-Team, Pentest, Enumeration Tool"

Overall Objective:
    As I learn and build scripts to automate/perform various tasks that Enumerate and test an infrastructures security posture,
    I want to include them in a platform that will allow others to run them on demand without having to rewrite them.
    The goal of this tool is to also allow the user to run these tools without having to install any extra dependencies outside the github package.
    Things like Nmap/AD RSAT modules/powercat/etc will be included in this repo.

Design:
    The Current Design of this Tool is to build everything (Custom menus/commands) into functions, so that all "C.A.R.P.E." needs to do find and 
    import them. As for third party Modules/Software, C.A.R.P.E. will be able to import/call them as well.

Local Enumeration:

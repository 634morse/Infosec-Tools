Nmap Documentation

NOTE: WHEN Scanning, if every IP in a range is coming back "up" when you know those are not valid hosts,
      The firewall may be sending back packets to throw the scan off. I have noticed this happens when running scans over the vpn

Running Nmap through this Program provides a few benefits
    * It allows the option to export the data to a csv (Nmap can only do XML, along with a few others)
        I personally along with others find it easier to work with csv files when parsing out the data/give it to others

    * No need to remember syntax
        While it is good to understand how the tool works and how the different methods of scanning work, it is nice to just select a few options without always remembering syntax.
        This also allows others to perform scans without having to go learn all the syntax

4 main options for each scan method
    * Import CSV for batch scan and export to csv
    * Import CSV for batch scan and display results in shell
    * Manually give a range to scan and export to csv
    * Manually give a range to scan and disaply results in shell

How each Scan works

    PING SCAN:
        Performs Host-discovery without scanning the ports
        Per Nmap Documentation https://nmap.org/book/man-host-discovery.html

        The default host discovery done with -sn consists of an ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default.
        When executed by an unprivileged user, only SYN packets are sent (using a connect call) to ports 80 and 443 on the target.

    PORT SCAN:
        Scans Ports (either all or ones specified) and gives a status on whether they are open/closed/filtered/etc
        By Default Nmap will try to use TCP SYN Scans as it is quick, and stealthy as it never completes the full TCP Connection
        If TCP SYN Cannot be used, it will perform a TCP Connection Scan (completes the full TCP Handshake)

        Per Nmap Documentation 
            https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html
            https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html

    STEALTH SCAN:
        This scan is the same as a port scan, but it uses the switch "-sS" to force Syn packets so that the TCP handshake is never fully completed

    SMB SCAN:
        This scan checks to see if the smb port 445 is open and whether or not smb signing is enabled/disabled and/or required/not-required
